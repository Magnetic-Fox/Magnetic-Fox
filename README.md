- 👋 Hi, I’m @Magnetic-Fox
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, learning new programming languages, composing and producing music, manga, anime, fantasy, retrocomputing (PC, Amiga, C64), etc. (well, a lot of things) 😉
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 16-bit WinAPI (because I always loved 16-bit Windows programs) 🙂
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (hehe, currently TBA someday 😉)
- 📫 How to reach me - well, for now on Facebook or LinkedIn, I think. 🙂 You can also visit my site, which currently needs (REALLY!) to be refurbished and translated to English: http://magnetic-fox.ppa.pl/ 😉
